#Wrangling with MongoDB

##*Data Wrangle OpenstreetMaps Data: Greater Toronto Area (GTA)*

### A Project made while taking Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

**The Dataset:** An 1.5GB XML file from *mapzen - Metro Extracts* about the GTA.

**The Quest:** Munge (explore, audit and clean) the data before importing it to a MongoDB database where more exploration can be done.

**Comments:** I learned some new interesting facts about my city. The Great Toronto Area is a diverse metropolis that gave me the perfect
chance to sharpen my wrangling skills.

**Technologies Used:** python, MongoDB, regex
